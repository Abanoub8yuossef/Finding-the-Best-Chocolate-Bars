# Finding-the-Best-Chocolate-Bars
Investigating a dataset to answer some questions related to the origin of cocoa beans, ingredients, percent of cocoa and many things to find the best chocolate bar. 

## ðŸ’ª Challenge Summary Of findings:

## 1. What is the average rating by country of origin?
## 2. How many bars were reviewed for each of those countries?
## 3. Create plots to visualize findings for questions 1 and 2.
## 4. Is the cacao bean's origin an indicator of quality? 

* many of the origins rated less than 50 times, and it is very missleading because in the first graph for this question you can see that china has the highest average rating, but it actualy rated one time only !! 
    
* so we may need to deciede to slice the data to include the origins that only had 50 reviews or higher.
 
### after that you can find 
#### 1. Venezuela rated 246 times with average 3.239 & highest number of rate "3" = 58
#### 2. Peru rated 231 times with average of 3.228
#### 3. Dominican Republic rated 220 times wtih average 3.219 & highest number of rate "3.25" = 48 & highest number of rate "3.75" = 40
#### 4. Ecuador rated 201 times with average of 3.213 & highest number of rate "3.5" = 54
    
the cacao bean's origin is not always an indicator of quality. as the relation between the bean_origin and avg rating for all origins that reviewed more than 50 times are between 3.28 and 3.08

## 5. [Optional] How does cocoa content relate to rating? What is the average cocoa content for bars with higher ratings (above 3.5)?

* after investingation we can determind that 70% cocoa content is the highest rated bar with 783 rates and most of them are above 3.25
* the increas of cocoa content percent in the chocolate bar did not garanty the quality of chocolate.


## 6. [Optional 2] Your research indicates that some consumers want to avoid bars with lecithin. Compare the average rating of bars with and without lecithin (L in the ingredients).

* average rating of hocolate bars with Lecithin:  3.1628
* average rating of hocolate bars without Lecithin:  3.2371
#### *reviews and average ratings for chocolate bars without Lecithin are higher than with Lecithin.
